## 📘 Project Overview
This template provides a clean, modular starting point for **individual researchers** looking to train, finetune, or run experiments on Hugging Face models using LoRA, Accelerate, and Hydra.

It is structured for flexibility, reproducibility, and rapid experimentation, while keeping the project lightweight and self-contained.

---

## 📂 Directory Structure

- `configs/` – YAML config files managed by Hydra
- `src/` – Your actual code (data loading, model logic, training loop, etc.)
- `scripts/` – Shell scripts to launch training/evaluation easily
- `run.py` – Entrypoint to your training job
- `.env` – W&B and private environment variables

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Modular Hydra configs (switch model/data/train settings easily)
- ✅ Native Weights & Biases logging integration
- ✅ Accelerate/trl-ready training loop (custom loss supported)
- ✅ PEFT/LoRA support for lightweight LLM finetuning
- ✅ Hugging Face `datasets` and `transformers` integration

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone <this-template-url> my_project
cd my_project
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up environment variables
Add your W&B API key to `.env`:
```bash
WANDB_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### 4. Run training
```bash
python run.py
```

To override a config:
```bash
python run.py train.batch_size=8 model.model_name=bert-base-uncased
```

---

## 🛠️ Todo (for you to implement)
- Fill in `src/data.py` with your dataset logic
- Define your model or load via Hugging Face in `src/model.py`
- Implement training steps inside `src/trainer.py`
- Add evaluation code in `src/eval.py`

---
